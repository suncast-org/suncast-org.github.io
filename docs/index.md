# 🌞 SUNCAST — Software UNified Collaboration for Advancing Solar Tomography

Welcome to **SUNCAST**, an open-science initiative dedicated to developing a modern, sustainable, and community-driven software ecosystem for advancing 3D studies of the solar corona.

SUNCAST supports research that combines ground-based and space-based remote-sensing observations with physics-based forward modeling, spectral fitting, and data-constrained tomography. The SUNCAST ecosystem is built around interoperable, cloud-ready tools and reproducible workflows that help the community analyze, model, and understand the 3D structure of the solar corona.

## 🎯 Mission

SUNCAST accelerates scientific discovery by:

- providing open, interoperable, HPC-ready software tools,
- supporting the transition from legacy codes to scalable, cloud-capable systems,
- training early-career researchers and broadening participation (MSIs, PUIs, and beyond),
- fostering reproducibility and open-science best practices,
- building a community-owned, community-driven software ecosystem.

Our development practices are guided by the **FAIR**, **CARE**, and **TRUST** principles, ensuring transparency, reproducibility, ethical stewardship, and long-term sustainability.

## 🧭 Governance & Community

SUNCAST is establishing a **Governance Board** and community processes that support:

- transparent decision-making,
- open participation,
- long-term sustainability of key workflows,
- recognition of contributor effort,
- equitable access to tools and training resources.

You can learn more about how SUNCAST is governed and how to get involved in the **[Governance](governance.md)** and **[Contributing](contributing.md)** pages.

## 🔭 Core Tools & Workflows

SUNCAST currently supports and develops several key tools, including:

- **pyGSFIT** — microwave spectral fitting and forward modeling of solar emission,
- **pyAMPP** — NLFFF-based magnetic modeling and data-constrained field reconstruction,
- **pyGSK** — Generalized Spectral Kurtosis (GSK) toolkit for radio data analysis.

Additional community workflows, real-data pipelines, and training examples will be added as the project grows. See the **[Projects](projects.md)** page for an evolving overview.
