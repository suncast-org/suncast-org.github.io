# 🛠️ SUNCAST Governance Model

SUNCAST is committed to building an open, inclusive, and sustainable ecosystem of tools and workflows for data-driven solar tomography and heliophysics research. To support a diverse contributor community, SUNCAST provides **two complementary paths** for participating in software development.

---

## 🚀 1. Organization-Initiated Projects (Top-Down Path)

SUNCAST may create repositories directly under the **suncast-org** GitHub organization when:

- the project is a flagship workflow,
- it supports core deliverables (e.g., pyGSFIT, pyAMPP, pyGSK),
- or it is part of an NSF-funded activity.

### Contribution workflow

1. The repository is hosted under `suncast-org`.
2. Contributors fork the repository to their own accounts.
3. All additions or fixes are proposed via **Pull Requests (PRs)**.
4. A maintainer reviews, discusses, and merges the PR.

This ensures transparency, reproducibility, and long-term code sustainability.

## 🌱 2. Contributor-Initiated Projects (Bottom-Up Path)

SUNCAST also supports independent scientific innovation. Any researcher, student, or collaborator may:

1. Create and develop a new tool in **their own personal GitHub repository**.
2. Mature the project independently during its early exploratory phase.
3. When ready, request that the project be **transferred to the SUNCAST organization**.

### After transfer

- Full commit history is preserved (provenance protected).
- The original author may serve as a maintainer.
- Additional contributors participate through forks + PRs.

This path enables open participation and encourages early creativity without requiring prior permission from SUNCAST.

## 📜 3. Guiding Principles

All SUNCAST repositories and contributions follow:

### FAIR Principles

- **F**indable  
- **A**ccessible  
- **I**nteroperable  
- **R**eusable  

### CARE Principles

- **C**ollective Benefit  
- **A**uthority to Control  
- **R**esponsibility  
- **E**thics  

### TRUST Principles

- **T**ransparency  
- **R**esponsibility  
- **U**ser Focus  
- **S**ustainability  
- **T**echnology  

These values guide software design, documentation, licensing, and community engagement.

## 🧭 4. Governance Structure (In Formation)

SUNCAST is establishing a **Governance Board** consisting of:

- core developers,
- domain scientists,
- early-career contributors,
- representatives from participating institutions.

The Board will:

- maintain development standards,
- review contribution proposals,
- approve repository transfers,
- guide documentation and reproducibility,
- coordinate training and community support.

Until the Board is formally established, the SUNCAST PI team serves as the interim governing body.

## 🤝 5. How to Get Involved

You can contribute by:

- submitting issues or feature requests,
- improving documentation,
- contributing examples or tutorials,
- submitting Pull Requests,
- developing independent projects and transferring them into SUNCAST,
- participating in SUNCAST workshops and community forums.

SUNCAST welcomes contributors from all backgrounds and especially encourages participation from **MSIs**, **PUIs**, students, and early-career researchers.
