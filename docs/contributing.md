# 🌟 Contributing to SUNCAST

Thank you for your interest in contributing! SUNCAST welcomes contributions from researchers, students, and developers worldwide. This page provides the practical steps required to contribute code, documentation, or new tools.

## 🧰 Contribution Workflow (For All Repositories)

1. **Fork the repository** you want to contribute to (under the `suncast-org` organization).
2. **Create a feature branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```
3. **Make your changes** (code, docs, tests, examples).
4. **Commit with clear messages**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new SK threshold example"
   ```
5. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** to the repository under `suncast-org`.
7. Participate in the review process and address comments as needed.

After approval, a maintainer will merge your contribution.

## 🌱 Starting New Projects

If you want to propose a new tool or workflow:

### Option A: Independent development (recommended for new ideas)

1. Create the repository under your personal GitHub account.
2. Develop and test your idea freely.
3. When the project is ready for broader use, request a **repository transfer** into the SUNCAST organization.

This models the **bottom-up** contribution path and allows for experimentation before committing to long-term maintenance.

### Option B: Start directly under SUNCAST (for coordinated efforts)

If the project is part of a planned SUNCAST deliverable or collaborative effort, ask a maintainer or Governance Board member (once established) to create a repository under `suncast-org`. From there, everyone contributes via forks and PRs.
